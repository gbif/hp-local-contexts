The GBIF Indigenous Data Governance Pilot Portal provides a practical proof-of-concept for integrating [Traditional Knowledge](https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/) (TK) and [Biocultural](https://localcontexts.org/labels/biocultural-labels/) (BC) [Labels](https://localcontexts.org/labels/about-the-labels/) and [Notices](https://localcontexts.org/notices/about-the-notices/) metadata with associated data published via the GBIF network. 

This pilot portal is co-developed with [Local Contexts](https://localcontexts.org/), the Indigenous Data Governance cyberinfrastructure provider of TK and BC Labels and Notices, to support and advance the work of the [GBIF Indigenous data governance task group](https://www.gbif.org/news/1Ke3Gk2USgdIW5OgDlBIKY/). The experience gained through the experiments undertaken in this pilot portal will help the GBIF IDGov task group establish network-wide guidance on standards and norms around Indigenous Data Governance for GBIF members who wish add share these rights declarations to the data they publish, and the pilot's resultswill chart a path forward for increasing the inclusion of Indigenous data governance across GBIF's communities of practice. 

Visitors who wish to follow this work can do so by joining the [GBIF Indigenous data community mailing list](https://gbif.link/Indigenous-data-community).
